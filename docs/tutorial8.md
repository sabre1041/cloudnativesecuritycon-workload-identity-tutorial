# Tutorial 8 - Conclusion

This tutorial covered the introduction to Zero Trust principles in workload identity management, which enhances security by granting access based on caller identity rather than long-lived credentials. The focus was on using SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone) and SPIRE (SPIFFE Runtime Environment) to secure systems beyond public cloud environments, applicable to any infrastructure. Attendees gained knowledge and practical skills to implement these patterns.

We introduced the fundamental principles of Zero Trust and workload identity management, highlighting how these approaches enhance security by using caller identity instead of long-lived credentials.

To harden the architecture, we went through an exercise to decouple credentials from the application by removing the static credentials at rest within the cluster and storing them in a secret management solution, Vault, where they can be rotated dynamically and independently of the application.

This instance of Vault was configured to enable authentication using a JWT provided by SPIRE. Then, we granted policies for only specific identities, like our application, to have access to secrets.

By leveraging SPIFFE and SPIRE, we demonstrated how to secure an application by adding a simple sidecar that uses this application identity to access Vault, obtain dynamically managed credentials, and then inject them into the application.

We hope this tutorial provides you with a pattern example that can significantly harden the security posture of your deployed application.

## Cleanup 

To remove all the components installed during the workshop, execute the following commands:

```shell
envsubst < $TUTORIAL_ROOT/cloudnativesecuritycon-workload-identity-tutorial/resources/secure/apps/py.yaml | kubectl delete -f -
envsubst < $TUTORIAL_ROOT/cloudnativesecuritycon-workload-identity-tutorial/resources/secure/vault/vault.yaml | kubectl delete -f -  
envsubst < $TUTORIAL_ROOT/cloudnativesecuritycon-workload-identity-tutorial/resources/baseline/py.yaml | kubectl delete -f - 
kubectl delete -f $TUTORIAL_ROOT/cloudnativesecuritycon-workload-identity-tutorial/resources/baseline/db.yaml


helm --namespace spire-mgmt uninstall spire
helm --namespace spire-mgmt uninstall spire-crds
kubectl delete ns spire-server spire-system spire-mgmt vault workload-identity-tutorial
